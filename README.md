# Boomerang Attack on 2-Round AES

A Boomerang Attack on 2-Round AES has been done in the code. Maximum probable trail has been considered for both $\alpha$ to $\beta$ and $\gamma$ to $\delta$. 
Sean Murphy equations for AES has been evaluated to perform the attack on valid $\gamma$ corresponding to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ fixed perviously.
